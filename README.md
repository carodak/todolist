Realization: Application to create a task (punctual or long), edit it and display the list of tasks. Done in JAVA during my third year of bachelor.

A task must be completed for a given date (the due date), the granularity will be the day (when a task must be completed for a day d, it is implied that it is due for day d in the evening, so it becomes late only on day d+1. The due date can be modified at any time as long as the task is not completed. The deadline is imperatively posterior to the date of creation of the task. A task has a title and possibly a category, the title and the category are modifiable at any time as long as the task is not realized.

Objective:

Make a small application to manage the tasks of a person like a "todolist".

Note: The work could be improved by performing tests with JUnit and using MVC model.
